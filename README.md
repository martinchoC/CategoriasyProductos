# Categories and Products
A Tictapps test project

The application begins displaying a list of categories containing products people use in their daily life. Each Category shows its name
and the number of products it has.
When a category is selected, a list of products corresponding to the category selected is shown. Each product is represented in the list
with its name and its price (if it has).
With a long press in the product, it is possible to modify or remove it.
In the action Bar of the Product screen, there are two buttons: filter and add a new product. With the filter button the list could be 
displayed in three different ways: expired products, products available (having stock) and products created in the last 90 days.

How to create a new product:
    First press the (+) button on the products screen and complete the fields. It is necessary to complete title, stock, creation and expiration dates.
Then press the return button twice to save the product.

How to filter the products:
    Press the filter button near the (+) button on top of the products screen and a popup will appear. There choose an option to filter the products
belonging to a category.
IMPORTANT: The creation and expiration of a product is set at 00:00:00 am

How to edit/remove a product:
    The product item should be pressed and mantaining it selected. Then a popup will appear, allowing you to choose the edition or removal of the product.
If you want to edit the product, the procedure to edit it is the same as create a new one.
