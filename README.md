# CategoriasyProductos
A Tictapps test project

The application begins displaying a list of categories containing products people use in their daily life. Each Category shows its name
and the number of products it has.
When a category is selected, a list of products corresponding to the category selected is shown. Each product is represented in the list
with its name and its price (if it has).
With a long press in the product, it is possible to modify or remove it.
In the action Bar of the Product screen, there are two buttons: filter and add a new product. With the filter button the list could be 
displayed in three different ways: expired products, products available (having stock) and products created in the last 90 days.
